\title{Interview Transcript}
\author{Susanne Snyder, Joni Blank, Lee Davidson}
\date{April 5, 2011}
\maketitle

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Okay. This is Susanne Snyder on April 5, 2011, with Joni Blank and Lee Davidson. We're at Swan's Way in Joni Blank's home, and I'm going to ask both Joni and Lee to introduce themselves.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Okay. I'm Joni Blank, as Susanne said, and I was born on the 4th of July in 1937, which is why I'm told I'm so independent. My main claim to fame is that I started Good Vibrations. A lot of people know about that, but many do not realize that I also ran a small publishing company. Some people know about my books, but they don't know about the publishing part of it. And that's a good start, I hope.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} My name is Lee Davidson. I was born in 1946 in Rhode Island. Growing up, I always said I wanted to do something with books and languages when I grew up. So I guess that's what I did. I worked in the publishing world for several years and also did some financial work. And that's what I'm doing now.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Great. Thank you. I would love to start by asking you to try and remember how you two met. I hope you remember, Lee, because I don't.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Well, I think we met through another publisher, Ruth Godstein, who is the publisher of Volcano Press. She also had a company that did group book exhibits at book shows like the American Booksellers Association. She would go to the Bologna Book Fair and the Frankfurt Book Fair. I believe Joni would send down her press books as part of this group exhibit. At some point, I guess I met Joni. Does that sound familiar?

\textbf{Joni Blank:} That sounds familiar, yes. Well, it sounds plausible, but I don't remember it. There was also the fact that I think I had gone away or gone back east for a year. One of the books I had published, *Period*, had really taken off, and I felt that I couldn't keep it going from a distance. So I sold the rights or something to Volcano Press. I guess I came back when I got back to the West Coast, and we talked. Maybe that was the first time I actually met you. I remember that.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Well, I know we're going to talk about the several ways in which both of you have been part of the publishing world, feminism, and sexuality. Before we even do that, I wanted to know if I could learn a little bit more about your very early life.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} I'm going to go first. My life is longer than Lee's, so I'll only tell you about the earliest part. I thought a lot about how I ended up working in the sexuality field, even before I opened the store. The thing that's most relevant to bring up here is what I recall when I tell my sex history, which I've done in small and large groups over the years during workshops and things. It's the ways in which my family encouraged me to be comfortable with sex—much more comfortable with sexuality. Less so my own sexuality, but talking about it was not a big deal for me, and that's because my parents were that way. Both my mother and my father were very open and comfortable with nudity. I mean, not much was known about how sexuality functioned. My mother was born in 1920, and my father in 1940. Even though they were progressive people who were well-read, nobody knew much about sexual response or any of that kind of stuff.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} That's interesting.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} I'll tell you one little anecdote. After giving my sex history to many groups of various sizes as part of leading workshops and eliciting those stories from others, I decided it would be fun to tell my parents my sex history the way I tell it to these strangers and ask them. So they came to visit. I was already living in California. They came from the East Coast to visit my husband and me. My two parents sat around, and I told them my sex history. My mother listened carefully, and one of the things she learned was that I didn't learn about masturbation until I was almost 24 years old, after I had my first sexual encounter with another person. She was apparently shocked to hear this and surprised. I asked her afterwards, “How come you didn't encourage or tell my sister about masturbation or find some way of letting us know that it was an option?” She said, “Well, I just assumed you were doing it since you were little. Doesn't everybody?” That's the kind of parents I had.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} That's fascinating.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} So that's a little bit about my early life. I grew up in a suburb of Boston and lived in several different places. I worked as a health educator in health departments from the time I was trained in health education. I was involved in various aspects of health education, including family planning. I did that for quite some time until I got hooked into the sex field after I moved to California. I also did that when I first came to California and then switched into working in sex through a couple of fluky things. I was really aware that one of the reasons people were having a hard time being effective contraceptors and making decisions about sexuality was that they were uncomfortable with their sexuality or just didn't know very much about it. So that was an easy switch for me.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And you mentioned that your parents were very comfortable. Do you have a sense of why they were comfortable?

\textbf{Joni Blank:} I actually don't know that. I think my mother was probably more comfortable than my father.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} I actually think it may have had something to do with them trying to be really progressive parents and reading someplace that it was okay to talk to your kids about sex. But I'm not, I don't actually know that. I think it was, I've given a lot of thought to this obviously because I've been asked about it frequently. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} A lot of it had to do with the things I covered and the little book that I wrote for really little kids, which don't really seem to have stuff to do with sex. I have to do with parents, the way parents show affection to one another, the way parents act and feel about nudity, and their reactions to things. 

When you're really little, one of the important aspects is privacy. How do they feel about privacy? They don't teach you about that; they just show it by the way they live. For example, we always slept with our doors open—my sister's bedroom door was always open, and my parents' bedroom door was always open. 

In retrospect, I know it was probably closed sometimes because they did not want us walking in on them when they were having sex. But basic attitudes about sex being a normal, natural thing meant that you didn't have to be secretive about it. 

Around nudity, it was very common for both my parents to be in the shower or the bathtub while my sister and I would be sitting on the toilet talking to them at the same time. It was like, that's what you did. My parents were not nudists; they didn't parade around without clothes on, even in hot weather. But they would go to bed, get dressed, and go back and forth to the bathroom. 

Believe me, one of the first times I ever learned about erections, I was shocked. I had seen my father frequently and had seen male genitals before, but erections? Oh, I was quite old by then. You don't get to be in high school and not have some sense of what an erection is about, even if you haven't actually seen one.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And Lee, can you tell me a little bit about where you come from?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Well, I grew up in Rhode Island. I think my family was not... well, I know they weren't nearly as open-minded as Joni's. I think I came into the publishing scene more from a women's health perspective. I mean, it wasn't like I studied health or anything in school or college. I kind of liked the sciences, but I also liked the social sciences. 

As I say, it was books and languages and women's health. When I landed in San Francisco in the early '70s, I started volunteering with the Women's Needs Center, which was the Women's Program Family Planning Center for the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinics. Then I started working with Ruth, who was doing a lot of women's books. She did the first domestic violence book, *Battered Wives*, and brought issues to public consciousness with *Conspiracy of Silence*. 

So she was addressing a lot of women's issues. When she moved Volcano Press up to the mountains, I started to work with Joni. That was just another aspect of women's health. I think I borrowed a phrase that Marcy Shiner used once: I sort of felt I was the messenger taking this passionate message to the rest of the world.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} I'm looking forward to hearing about that transition from Volcano Press to Down There Press. And maybe this is a good time to ask you, Joni, if you could tell me about creating Down There Press.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Well, I didn't create it. It just happened. The first book I did was *The Playbook for Women About Sex*. I was leading these women's sexuality workshops—day-long workshops for women—and we called it *It's Not a Secret Anymore*. They were just general workshops getting people to share their sex histories and learn about sexual anatomy and fantasy, you know, all this kind of stuff. 

I thought it would be fun to actually teach this workshop with somebody else, and I thought it would be fun to teach it with someone who identified as a lesbian. I identified as heterosexual then. I had a good friend named Marney Hall, and I invited her over one day to see what I did in the workshops and just chat about them. 

Either I had the idea, or we ended up not doing them together, but I had the idea that it would be fun to create a workbook for people who couldn't come to the workshop, so they could get some of those same experiences by doing the various exercises in workbook form. As I described this project to her, she said that sounded really great. 

We started chatting about that instead, and I decided to pursue it. I don't think I had even started it at that time. Anyway, we ended up not doing workshops together. She said, "You have it all together; you have a really good system here. I can't particularly add anything to it." That's my memory of it a little bit. 

So when it came time to make the women's playbook, I was just going to make them initially just to hand out to people in the workshop to take home. That was sort of a handout for the workshop. I was going to do a bunch of pages and just kind of staple them together. Then I decided, "Well, I'll print some. I'll have some printed—maybe 100 copies—and then I'll start giving them to people." 

This was two years before the store was even thought of in my mind. I was working at the sex counseling program, and that's how I met Marney, actually.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Just think of some cool name and make up, you know, gotta become a \textit{publisher}... I don't even know if she used the word publisher, but she should make more copies than that. Maybe a thousand or something like that. A thousand. A thousand. I didn't know anything about publishing, and she didn't know much either, I guess, but I decided, okay, and I thought a little bit about the name and came up with this cute name, \textit{Down There Press}, which, as you know, some people want to call down their books. And I know it's very important that it be \textit{Down There Press} as in press down there. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} *laughs*

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And what year was this that the workbook... the first playbook came out?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} The first playbook was published in 1975, and the store actually opened in 1977. In the meantime, I did the playbook for \textit{Man About Sex}. Actually, that was after the store was open. And the playbook for \textit{Kids About Sex}. Those were my first three books.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And where did the playbook sell?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Um... Yeah, I don't know. You know, I think at that time, I tried to sell through mail order. I remember buying an ad in \textit{Ms. Magazine} before they freaked out and said they wouldn't carry my ads anymore. This was not a \textit{sex magazine}. But I don't think anybody ever bought it from there. I think I bought a classified ad there. Mail order was like unheard of back then. I did actually, I'm remembering now, that I think I took it around to a few bookstores and asked them if they would take it on consignment. That's what we did in those days for a few books here and there. I'm not exactly sure when I did that, but I drove around, and I don't even remember where I promoted it, but I sold many of them by mail. 

I would go to meetings of sex educators at that time and would sell a few there. I don't remember most of it. I eventually... I used to do this out of a table in my dining room where I lived down in the suburbs, and on the Peninsula and Berkeley. Eventually, I bought a little trailer, and it became my office, which we parked in the backyard. Fortunately, the people who lived in my home before I bought it were potters, and they had built this concrete slab in the backyard to put their kilns on. It was a perfect place to park my trailer, and now it has been rigged up for plumbing and electricity. 

It was easy to manage with the trailer, and I would sit out there, wrap books, and go to the post office. I didn't have anybody helping me at that time. And that was the center. That was \textit{Down There Press}. That was a little hub that boomed. And it was, you know, I had a home office for \textit{Good Vibrations} too in that sense. It was the same place.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} So do you want to mention \textit{Good Vibrations} and date-wise? I feel like...

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I want to mention it. Let's see. So \textit{Down There Press}, I'm sorry, but let's make it clear. So \textit{Good Vibrations}, just so you could kind of put this in context. \textit{Down There Press}, you said this is in the '70s. \textit{Down There Press} started, my first book had a publication date of 1975.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} 1975, okay. And it still opened in 1977. Okay. So if you could just explain what happened between '75 and '77 with \textit{Good Vibrations}.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I started... I remember all this stuff. I have a terrible memory. My sister should be sitting here; she has an excellent memory, not for my life, but she remembers everything. And I never remember anything. Let's see. The store was initiated because the sex counseling program, which was at UCSF, the Medical Center for the University of California, decided to lay off just about everybody who worked for the sex counseling program that didn't have a PhD. 

They used to be part of the Department of Ambulatory and Community Medicine, and that relationship wasn't very satisfactory to the university for reasons I don't know much about. So they decided to make it part of the Department of Psychiatry, and then they wanted doctors and cut their staff substantially. Somebody else who was cut was actually one of the co-founders of San Francisco Sex Information, my friend Tony Ayers. I said to her, you know, we were doing pre-orgasmic workshops for women who were non-orgasmic, and we were realizing that one of the things we did... we didn't start with this because we wanted women to learn to be comfortable touching themselves, but sometimes we did recommend vibrators, and the places to buy them were just...

So I said to Tony one day, as we were conversing, that both of us were losing our jobs there. She subsequently became a therapist; she was a nurse and could have actually stayed working there if she had had that license at the time. I said, "So Tony, why don't you start a vibrator store?" She said, "Nah, I don't want to do that. You do it." So I did. That was the story I told, and that's kind of what happened. It wasn't quite that quick, but it just seemed like a place that needed to be—somewhere women could go and buy vibrators.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And Lee, in '75, when the workbook was published, what were you doing at that time?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} What was I doing? I was working for New Glide. I was working for a bunch of people who were self-employed consultants, and I would keep their checkbooks, type their letters. You know, I was their personal assistant, whatever. Some of them I went to three days a week, some of them were once every two weeks. You know, I had a woman who did communication workshops, and that's where I saw one of Joni's flyers for her UC workshops. I had a historian, a law professor, a physician, and later I think I had an archivist. It was all word of mouth, and it was all within walking distance of my home, which was very convenient. 

I was doing a tremendous

\begin{document}

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} So, I was keeping the checkbook, editing manuscripts, I guess. In those days, you worked with a typesetter instead of the person doing the page layout. There'd be a lot of proofreading and checking the galleries. I remember one time we had sent a cover proof over to the designer, and he said, "Isn't your address 330 Ellis? Not 300?" It's like, oh, golly. 

Dealing with the printers, just getting the books out and trying to sell them was hard because it was a small press. The chains at the time were Walled In Books and the predecessor to Barnes \& Noble. There were two book chains that were much smaller, and they were impossible to deal with. You'd sell them books, and they'd return the books in boxes that were much too small for them. They would want their credits, and you'd tell them no, the books are not in resellable condition. They would send you to collections. Oh, that was just horrible. 

Barnes \& Noble at the time was primarily a... Borders, that's what it was called. No, it's pre-Borders. Yeah, it must have been Dalton's. Borders didn't exist. That was still a bookstore in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Barnes \& Noble sold college books. Ingram was a... and Baker \& Taylor primarily supplied the libraries. They were not in the... 

I went to a workshop at ABA, I think in Las Vegas in the early '90s, and the panel of distributors and wholesalers. The guy from Ingram got up and he basically said, "We're going to take over the world." And by golly, they pretty much have. 

You mentioned before, when we were off tape, just how you learned all this. Who taught you to do all these things?

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Well, Ruth Gots, dying of Volcano Press, which had started out as Glide Publications and then became New Glide Publications. It was a part of Glide Memorial Methodist Church or their foundation, which has become very well known because of its pastor, Cecil Williams. The church or the foundation started Glide, I think, in the late '60s or the very early '70s with a social mission, which was why they published books about battering and the conspiracy of silence about incest, and various other progressive topics from the '60s or early '70s, such as prisoners' rights. I can't remember them all. 

So when I started going to work with Ruth, New Glide, or as it shortly became Volcano Press, was in Glide Church. And that's not the greatest neighborhood. I mean, it was not the greatest neighborhood then in the early '80s, and it still isn't—the Tenderloin of San Francisco. We would go out to lunch and talk about plans for the future. Ruth would explain about printing and publishing, just the whole business of it. She was very generous about the way she shared her knowledge, which she had pretty much acquired on the fly, I think. 

You have to ask her about getting the independent presses into the American Booksellers Association annual shows. She's a real fighter. She spoke for all of the independent presses, especially in the Bay Area, but all over the country. She was probably the premier leader in getting small presses distributed in bookstores and heard about and available by mail order, you know, all the various things. 

She realized also that the reason independent publishing, small press publishing had been able to exist was due to a shift from hot type, you know, where you're pouring the lead, to cold type, where the galley proofs are all computer-generated. At the time, we were still getting long strips of paper, but it was generated basically by computer, and it was much cheaper. 

The West Coast publishers started to publish their books with paper covers because it was cheaper. You could do a book for, well, back then, maybe 50 cents a book, a dollar a book, whereas the cloth cover was three or four dollars a book. 

\textit{Publishers Weekly}, the major review media, didn't acknowledge paperbound books as real books. They weren't reviewed, so you had no way to get the word out. There was no internet, and the paperbound books were always released three or four years after the hardcover, at which point they weren't going to get reviewed again. So the idea to start with a paperbound book—that's what Lee's talking about—was new in those days. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Right. Publishers went from cloth to mass market size, pocket book size. The trade or quality paperback, as it was also known, was more of a West Coast kind of thing. Something would come out in those days, and you know, its very first edition was paperback. Of course, textbooks were the last things to catch up. It was years after that before textbooks came out in paper. 

Who did Ruth consider her peers at that point when she founded the press? 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} People probably like Phil Wood at Ten Speed Press, who died in January. He had done the "Anybody's Bicycle Book," a bicycle repair manual, and was famous for "What Color Is Your Parachute?" His company was... and some of the women's presses, I think, Spinsters. But I think we were bigger. Volcano Press was bigger than them. It wasn't just women's; I mean, Ruth kind of turned it towards a more woman-oriented focus. 

With the other... Oh, Ron Turner. She's... Last Gasp. Yeah, from Last Gasp Press. Sebastian Warfuli. And at... and/or Press, they did drug books. I mean, you know, it was the alternative press. So these are people that Ruth talked shop with. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Yeah. I'm proud to say that once upon a time, Ruth said—and I never forgot that she said—she didn't say "besides me," although she should have said that about herself. She said, "There are two geniuses in small publishing these days: Ron Turner and Joni Blank." She used the word genius. I'm like, oh, come on, Ruth. But that's what she said. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} So tell me about, I'm going to be interviewing Ruth too, but tell me about your relationship with Ruth and her press. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} The most important relationship that I had with Ruth was that I was her friend. I mean, even though she's quite a bit older than I am, I don't even remember a lot of the stuff about the press except that it was natural. For example, in the period, I didn't want to... It's sort of like giving away good vibrations. I also gave away period because I thought that it could get better distribution, et cetera, because she was then a much more

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And there were some other reasons. I think down there was Volcano Press in those days doing some other children's books. It was the only book I know; it was the first one that was the only one she ever did too, I guess. I'm not saying it was the only one she ever did, but that was the only one she was doing at the time. 

So I just felt a lot of... pardon me. You went back to Boston. Is that... but that was why I stopped doing \textit{period}. Was I was going to Boston? Yeah, well, my daughter was two and a half, between which is two and a half and three and a half. My husband and I decided we wanted to live someplace different for a year. We chose to go to Boston because that's where my parents were. They were quite elderly, and my daughter was quite young. I thought this was the only chance they were really going to get to know each other. 

There were some other reasons too, so we picked that place and we went for a whole year. I guess that was right around the time when I had been publishing \textit{period} for a while. Anyway, it just made sense for her to do it instead of me, so I pretty much gave it to her. I don't think she... Oh, she... I know what she gave me. I still had the foreign rights. So when foreign rights got sold, I got a little bit of income from that. I don't think I... I don't know that I charged her anything for the initial publishing rights. If I did, it wasn't very much. 

The point... I don't remember anymore. If you remember otherwise, you're probably correct, late. But I just know I liked her. I enjoyed being with her. We would socialize. I mean, we didn't do a lot. Right when I must have been... I don't even understand this. Because, you know, while I started earlier than I guess I opened the store, it was only like two and a half, three years after my daughter was born. My daughter was born in the same year that the store opened in November. She's still open in March. 

And I remember that I forgot what I was going to say. Never mind. Well, I was going to ask you, and if it comes back, just interrupt me. But when you started down there press, who were your peers, and who did you seek knowledge from? 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Ruth. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} So I'm interested in that because in one email exchange you jokingly said this project is titled \textit{Voices from the Radical Feminist Press} and you said, "Well, I don't know if this qualifies as feminist. I don't know if we were considered feminists. I don't know if I want to be called a feminist press." So this might be a good time to talk about that.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} I was fine about being called a feminist press, but I wasn't sure that the feminist press would include us as one of them. I was really interested in sex education for everybody. I mean, I was dealing with the women's stuff because it just seemed like, um, that was the sexuality that was coming out of the closet right and left in all ways. And I'm not talking about sexual orientation here; I'm just talking about in general. 

Like, my workshops were called, \textit{It's Not a Secret Anymore}. But it very quickly became obvious to me that I needed to educate, that we needed to educate. All of us needed to educate ourselves about sex—men and women alike. Part of the women coming out of the closet was a way of finding a way to be better understood by men. For those who had male partners, and even those who didn't have male partners, but by their fathers and brothers and stuff about what is happening to our daughters and our younger sisters. 

All of a sudden, these women that were married to men were like, "Hmm. I got to, you know, my reality's got to make some shifts or this relationship is not going to work out" in terms of their own partners. And some did, and some didn't. I mean, I have a lot of that, I think. Well, I don't know. That's sort of an attention I was about to go off on, so I won't. 

But, like, I was focused on sexuality. It was incidental that... this was right, incidental, not accidental, but in some ways it felt incidental to a lot of people to be pushing the general sex agenda. 

Like, I remember this specific event that happened in the store. The store was open, and I had the playbook for kids about sex, I mean for women about sex there. And the other books that I had published and maybe a handful of other titles in those days—I carried like six books because old wives' tales, the feminist books that were down the street away from the store. 

And so I was there. There was a young man in the store, an Asian young man who was very clearly very shy. He came in, and I said to him, "Can I help you?" He said, "No, I just want to look around." I said, "Okay." I just thought he was looking around, and he was looking at all the stuff. He didn't touch anything on the shelves or pick anything up or anything. He was clearly scared. 

Then these two women came into the store—a couple, I found I figured later, a lesbian couple—and I said to them in my same voice I said to him, "May I help you please? Would you like some help?" They said, "Not with him in here." I said, "Oh, okay." He quickly left, and I said, "Please come back later." I mean, I felt terrible. 

What I wish I had done then was chewed them out for treating my customer badly, but I didn't. I was kind of like, whoa. I was taking a bath, and they picked up the playbook for women about sex and they opened it up. There's a page in there where it says, "Here is a picture. There's a big circle and there's a place to draw in there. It says draw in this circle a picture of something that turns you on." 

Then I gave some examples, and I drew my own little pictures—I'm a terrible artist, but the first one was my hand, a little erect penis, a little cart, you know, and the ocean. I drew the waves in the ocean. They opened it up, and they were just offended like crazy that I had done that little picture of a penis and said, "His penis." I was like... and that was in the days when you spelled women with an L. At least that was their notion.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} But really, we can talk about women getting what they want sexually, but to actually discuss what that is—that's a different story. Anatomy and physiology and understanding sexual responses are pretty okay, but when we start talking about relationships and sex, particularly heterosexual sex, it feels like it doesn't belong here. We just don't talk about it. Worse than that, women who have sex with men, or even those who have fantasies about sex with men, can't even call themselves feminists. They are with people who feel that way. We're right in the middle of that. 

Were you getting this message? I mean, obviously you were, but where else were you receiving this message aside from these two customers who came in?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Well, I didn't really get the message from them. That was kind of indicative of what happened. Mostly, I participated in small press events and other activities with feminist publishers. They were all small presses too, but they held themselves apart from the mainstream press movement in some ways. They struggled with the same issues, like stores that would only take your books on consignment, and lots of returns—messy stuff that all small publishers dealt with. It was really hard to get reviewed in Publishers Weekly, and we often had to put a publication date on our books that was six months later than when we actually had them. So, we had to fake it, right? That's the only way to get published.

All those kinds of issues were struggles we all faced. But in terms of the content of what we were doing, many people in the feminist book movement accepted me on a personal basis. Many of them thought I was a lesbian, and they were freaked out when they found out that I identified as heterosexual. They wondered how I could possibly understand their sexuality because I didn't know anything about lesbianism. And anyway, even if I did, we just don't talk about that stuff. 

So, I would guess that was more where I got it. Some of it may have been of my own making. In retrospect, I see that I was holding myself apart from them because they were so tight about sex. I mean, I'm definitely exaggerating. On a personal one-to-one basis, they weren't uptight about sex, but I think they felt a little anxious about how sort of out there I was. The fact that I was heterosexual was a big issue for a number of people—not just in the publishing movement, but also in the community. 

There was a woman who ran a restaurant in the neighborhood of the store, and she created a map of women's businesses along Valencia Street. The second year, I got left out, and I found out it was because I was heterosexual. She claimed it was because I wasn't on Valencia Street, but I actually owned a business on that street. I would walk away, and it turned out there were other businesses that were a block away that were included. So, that was just an excuse. I simply wasn't part of that world.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} It's interesting to hear you say that lesbians and certain feminists were uptight about discussing sex because now, in nostalgic terms, there's a lot of boasting about how erotic the whole movement was.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Well, part of that, yeah, I understand. Different people are different, and some have had that reaction. But the public face of that particular branch of the small publishing movement was pretty... if not sex-negative, it was more like, "Well, that's not what we're into." It was sort of like the response of Ms. Magazine. You know, they would never accept an ad for Good Vibrations, even though our ad said, "Friendly, feminist, and fun." 

Even when I tried to get just the books part in, we had a separate catalog for a while called the Sexuality Library. It didn't have any toys in it, but I still couldn't get an ad in Ms. The last gasp of the ads in Ms. isn't really about the publishing, but it's indicative of what happened. I fought with Ms. for years to take an ad for Good Vibrations. 

There was even an issue where they published a long interview with Betty Dodson, but they wouldn't carry any books about masturbation. They wouldn't include her book in their catalog. I don't know whether she tried to sell her book, *Liberating Masturbation*, but someone said, "Well, the editorial department and the marketing people are two different worlds." They didn't want to have sex-related content in the ads.

Finally, after several attempts and years of confronting Gloria Steinem at one of the booksellers' meetings, I mentioned this problem to her. She said, "Oh yeah, I know all of this." I don't even remember what else she said; it doesn't matter. Eventually, they said, "Why don't you write the ad in a way that's acceptable to you?" 

I was told, "No, you write the ad, but you can't use the word 'vibrator' in your ad, and you can't use the name of the business because it's Good Vibrations." I said, "I'm supposed to advertise my store, which has a very popular name?" The store was already well-known, even by people who didn't live in the Bay Area. There was the Beach Boys song, *Good Vibrations*, and everybody got it. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Thank you.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Remember that company that made orange soda? They used *Good Vibrations* too for their ad. And I can't use the ad? That was the point where I basically said, "Take your ad and shut it."

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Did I see you scribbling something when we were talking about...?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Oh, one thing: the women's publishers and bookstores started to get together at the book shows annually. In the first year or two, I hadn't heard about it. It was kind of like, "Oh, well, where are the women's presses?" So then I started to go. There was a meeting the day before where everyone talked about, as Joni says, the common problems of distribution, printers, and whatnot.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And at one of the meetings, we had fairly recently brought out \textit{Famelia}, and we had this incredible publicity hit. \textit{Penthouse} magazine devoted a whole page to it. They printed it on this wonderful sort of tan, almost cardstock, which really set it off from the rest of the magazine. 

But a whole page featured a picture of the cover and a couple of the illustrations, which were photographs of the vulva. Oh my gosh, they loved it! They just thought it was great. The phones rang off the hook—both in mail order and at the front desk. We ran through that first printing of 5,000 books in no time at all. We had to go back to press right away, and it was wonderful because when you get a book like that, it allows you to print other books. It gives you the funds to print up things that aren't maybe going to do as well.

So, I get to ABA—or maybe it was Book Expo America by that time—and someone sitting next to me said, “Well, how does it feel to have something like \textit{Penthouse} talking about your book?” I said, “Well, it's paying for a lot of other books.” But there was that kind of... the sex books aren't quite right, or getting this publicity from a men's magazine like that isn't quite kosher. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Do you think that moral tide has changed?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I have no idea. Well, everyone had a niche. But some publishers, I think, did... I mean, I remember one publisher talking about... But we would never publish a... and then two or three years later, oh, they're doing a lot of romance books with a lot of sex in them.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} I want to ask you about printing those books because beginning with the workbook, I have heard a lot of stories that people took their either issues of a newspaper or a book to the printer they had been using. If it showed...

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} The illustrations from the beginning, for years and years, the biggest problems we had were... Like way back when, for that year we were in Boston, we were working on \textit{Men Loving Themselves}. I had published \textit{I Am My Lover} before that, a previous edition of \textit{I Am My Lover}. These books were photographic books of people masturbating—women's book and the men's book. They were really early in my publishing career as I look back on it. 

When I think about it, at least the first editions of the more... I think \textit{I Am My Lover} was actually from Boston. It was still in the 70s before... Can't wait. Anyway, it wasn't, it was a long time ago—'78, I think it was, or something like that. 

Anyway, the classic thing—actually, we probably had more experience of this than me. But my memory is that we would go to the various publishers. There were several printers, maybe a dozen of them or fewer, seven or eight, who did a lot of small press books, and they were comfortable with short runs. People were doing as few as 1,000 books, and sometimes two or 3,000 or 5,000. For sure, there were some even fewer. 

These few publishers, these few printers would do them routinely. They were all in the Midwest, almost all in the Midwest. And they would happen as we would call up and get a quote on a book. To get a quote on a book, we would tell them right off hand, “It has photographs of men masturbating or women masturbating in this case.” Typically, if it was the estimator that we were talking to, he'd say, “It's fine with me, but I don't know how the boss is going to feel about this.” 

Then when the boss got asked, he would say, “It's fine with me, but my employees would quit if they had to work on this. So I can't take it.” Sometimes it went back and forth between the estimator and the president of the company, both of whom said, “We can't do it” for different reasons after saying, “Sure.” 

Sometimes it went to great lengths, like we sent them the whole galley, showing all of the pictures that were going to be in the book. After saying, “Sure,” then they'd say, “No, I think that only happened once where it went pretty far.” But usually, it was really hard to find them. 

Now, when we found a few people, and then, oh, with \textit{Anal Pleasure and Health}, oh my god, that time that was supposed to be hardcover for the first edition, we were going to do some paperback and some hardcover. The printer did it fine, and then it went to the... a binder. Even if it had just been softcovered, it would have had to go to a separate binder. 

This company was in the Detroit area—Ann Arbor, I don't remember. The Grims, that company that we printed with anyway, they sent the books to Grand Rapids to the largest binder of Bibles in the world. Every single box said, “Ain't No Pleasure in Half.” They sat in that warehouse in the binder for weeks and weeks and weeks before the binder called us up—I mean called up the printer and said, “We can't find it.” 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} So what happened?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} We actually found another binder, and then we had to pay shipping, I think, to the new binder. I can't even remember when it was—before my time.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Oh, it was before your time?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I don't remember exactly what happened. They had to pay shipping to get it to the new binder, and it wasn't easy to find them. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} So this happened to you?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} They didn't find them. I know that. They were going to send us... I know what they were going to do. Maybe this is what eventually happened. No, this is not what eventually happened, but they were going to send what they call folds and gathers, which means the book is already for binding. It just needs to be bound and then trimmed. They were going to send those to the Bay Area. 

I think that is what they ended up sending because that's what they had sent. They were going to send that to them, and I don't remember whether the same batch went. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Did you end up finding a trusted printer who eventually established relations with a company?

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} So, the first time we did that with Famalia, we were very much on Tentor Hooks and all. The books came in, and they had this green tape on them where they had been resealed, like customs had opened a couple or something. When I looked at them closely, written on this tape were things like, \textit{“This is a cool boy. I like.”} I saved those things; I don't know what happened to them.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} That's fantastic! 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Yeah, and there were a few missing, probably. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Yeah, there might have been. It doesn't matter. But actually, the first printing of Famalia, the printer did something that I think maybe those notes came in on. They sent a couple of boxes ahead of time, which kind of went through already. The purpose of having them do that was so that if customs tried to stop the bigger shipment, they could say, \textit{“But you've already passed some in.”}

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} So, who was helping you figure out and strategize that?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I mean, that was just phone calls.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Now, were you aligned at all? I mean, it sounds like you came partly from a women's health interest, and what you're doing is certainly linked. You were coming from counseling, right?

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Yeah. You know, I interviewed Francie Hornestein last night. Do you know her?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I don't.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} She also works in women's health. Were you aligned at all, informally or formally, with maybe not the feminist publishers, but the women's clinics?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I was. I wasn't as much. Well, I saw them as a market, but they didn't have any money. I mean, we did mailings to Planned Parenthood because they actually had a mailing list. Some of the Planned Parenthoods would buy a copy here or there, but nothing significant. This is a very, you know, they’d buy one copy for their library. It wasn't like they would buy, you know, a whole bunch of these workbooks for people to use in our class. I had some of that; I was teaching a human sexuality course at a community college then.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Yeah. And during that time, I remember sending out promotional pieces about our books, about several of our books, to people who taught human sexuality classes in various colleges and universities. I actually wanted to do a local thing with people who taught those courses because they were very scattered and often the only person on their campus who taught a class like that. They would teach for a couple of years and then get harassed all the time. So, if they had somebody else teach it, I just thought it would be really good to do some workshops for them to help each other out and support one another.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} And those workshops—well, that's not quite true. I did a couple of them at the meetings of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality because we were teaching college and community college and university courses. But from time to time, I would promote my books to one or another of those individuals, and there wasn't any organization of them. Although I used to go to the AASECT, which was the American Association of Sex Educators and Counselors, it was called then. Then it changed to AASECT, the Counselors and Therapists. They are an organization which, among other things, gives people the word I'm looking for, certificates of continuing education. You could become a certified sex educator or a certified sex therapist through them. You still can.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} And the other organization was the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex. In those days, it was called that; for many years, it's been the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality. I was much more active in that. I was actually on the board for a while, and I ran the national, I mean the regional conferences, and I used to attend every year. I mean, now I just go as a camper. At one time, I gave a paper at one of the AASECT meetings, but mostly I just went for my own interest. I was vitally interested in lots of aspects of the sex field, but it didn't have anything to do with the books that I was publishing.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Did anyone start publishing books about sex during this time that you recall or were interested in?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Cleis?

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Yeah, I'm thinking of before Cleis. Well, Cleis probably was doing some. There were individual people doing individual books, like Pat Califia published her book on lesbian SM and her general book on lesbian sexuality. Didn't she publish her book on the end?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Lulan published her book, and the publishers who published them were basically feminist publishers who were willing to publish those few books. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} How far do you remember the dates? 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} I remember that kind of stuff. I just remember individual titles, and even those I don't remember many of them. You know, we sold in this store, we sold \textit{Our Bodies, Ourselves}, and we sold these few books that were published by individual authors, some of whom self-published and some of whom had small publishers.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} And for someone trying to get a sense of Down There Press, how would you distinguish it from the books that began to come out of Cleis?

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Well, it's not just Cleis. Like I said, it's the same distinction that we're publishing books about sex, not books specifically about the stuff of women's sexuality, just women's sexuality coming out of Cleis that we're interested in.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} So, you were the only person?

\textbf{Joni Blank:} We were. We were, up until our very end, the only people who just published sex books. I think what I was describing as pansexual. I mean, other people were doing lesbian books or gay books. There was a big gay men's publishing scene. And then there were people like Greenery who were doing more towards the S&M. But we were the ones who were more trying to be universal about it—basic sex, whether you're a male or a female or a basic straight girl. The importance of being able to understand sexual response and how it works

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Can you tell me about the significance of your work in publishing erotic literature?

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Well, one of the significant things that happened was when we licensed \textit{Herodica} to a New York publisher. We were approached by an agent who said, “Oh, I can sell this to New York.” And he did; Penguin picked it up. The year it came out, there was a big article in the \textit{New York Times Magazine}. I think that was around 1992. 

So, there was a whole bunch of publishers deciding, “Okay, let's do erotica.” Most of them were not publishers of sex books—none of them were, right? 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Right.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} There’s an interesting story about how I decided to publish anything erotic. I had been publishing sexual self-help books and thought, “Don’t talk to me about erotica. I don’t even read it. I like it, but I’m not interested in it.” I thought, let somebody else who’s into the literary end of this do that. 

But there was another problem. I was convinced that if we were going to publish erotic short stories, which erotic novels were not, it would be hard to do. Novels were out of the question; I wasn’t interested, and we never did publish a novel. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} We did eventually publish \textit{Carol's Slither Daddy} in the fan...

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Oh, that’s true, but that was after my time. I was a reprieved company by then. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Right, but we weren’t the first publisher of that.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} No, I didn’t think so. Anyway, I actually went to talk to Pat, the woman who was the book review editor for the \textit{San Francisco Chronicle}, Patricia Holt. I had gotten to know her a little bit through the booksellers at the ABA meetings. 

I called her and said, “I’m Joni Blank,” and she said, “Oh, sure.” I went on to talk to her and said, “I’m thinking it might be a really good idea to publish a collection of... and I’m having a real problem. If I make a book that’s all lesbian, then heterosexual people probably won’t like it, especially men. But if I make a book that’s all heterosexual erotica, then lesbians won’t buy it.” 

The thought of doing a book that was about women, written by women, about whatever kind of sexuality didn’t even occur to me. I couldn’t figure out what to do with it. 

Pat said, “Don’t worry, just put them all together.” She encouraged me to do it. I thought, well, if the book reviewer for the \textit{San Francisco Chronicle} says this is a book that’s going to be in demand, then how did it go? 

We did it. Well, until \textit{Herodica 2} came out and had its big publisher, then I think the sales for \textit{Herodica 1} went up. We didn’t call it \textit{Herodica}; we just called it \textit{Herodica}. I think the sales from every new one would get a bump. 

In the early days, it was kind of like all of our other books. You know, we were a tiny little publisher, hard to get distribution. We were distributed by small press distributors. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I don’t remember that. You know Lena was much better than I do because I have a terrible memory for that sort of thing.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} So, SPD was your...

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Oh, no. We never worked with that.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} What? 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Book People and Inland.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Do you know about those two book distributors?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Well, Book People I’ve heard of.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Well, it’s a very sad story. They were a very creative company. They were a worker co-op, which eventually Good Vibrations became one too. But that was very ahead of its time. They actually made big news. They started in the 1960s or something. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Amazing.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} And Inland went bankrupt in the mid-2000s. Inland was actually an East Coast distributor that was started by a person who worked at Book People. It was kind of like a niece or nephew or child of Book People in that sense. 

I mean, all the other people who worked there were not, but they were basically doing a very similar thing to what Book People was doing. They had certain contacts so that small publishers had their books in both places. It was cheaper for a bookstore on the East Coast to get their books from Inland and not pay as much for shipping. 

But they weren’t formally associated with each other at all. Not at all. And even after Book People died, Inland was still going pretty strong.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} No, no, no. Excuse me. I take that back. Did Inland survive?

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Oh, I’m wrong about that. Inland went bankrupt. The principals created a company called LPC.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Oh, that’s why I forgot about that.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Yes, I forgot about that. And then LPC went bankrupt. And then Book People went bankrupt. I mean, I don’t know what’s going to happen with small presses with Borders going down. A friend of mine brought out a fairly big book last fall, and he said he lost $4,000—a net loss of $4,000. That’s a lot of money for a company. 

So, one of the Down There Press books, not one of mine, is probably going to have a revival even though most of them went to the shredder. That’s Martha’s book, \textit{The Big Book of Masturbation}. The reason that’s going to have a revival is the new movie called \textit{Sticky: The Movie}, which is about masturbation. 

I just talked to the producer of it yesterday because they put out a notice to all the people they know asking for contributions to cover the last $25,000 they need to finish it. They actually need more money than that. But the guy who’s doing it, I can’t remember the

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} No, maybe next year, maybe the following year. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Okay, yeah, that sounds soon. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Yeah. And so the book will be reissued and traveling on. I don't know what's going to happen. Martha's interviewed in the movie and I said, I forgot. But I forgot. I said, by the way, am I in that movie? Because I'm not in \textit{Orgas and Inc.}, which is another movie that's coming out very soon. And I wasn't in the book about the movie about vibrators. I wasn't interviewed in that one. How is that possible? 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Beats the hell out of me. I really would not have known about Rachel, nor would I have known about Tripoli if I hadn't put it into \textit{Good Vibrations}, or even if I had. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Right. Remember, you didn't want to do that. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I didn't remember that, but I'm so glad you did. Now I thought I did that. So explain it. I mean, I was the one who met Rachel first, and I knew about her work, which is how it went. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} So, okay, so Rachel Maynes wrote a wonderful book called \textit{The Technology of Orientalism}. And it's all about the history of vibrator use for sexual purposes. The play, \textit{The Vibrator Play}, what's it called? \textit{In Her Room} or something like that? It's a play about vibrators and it's based on Rachel Maynes' book. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Now, Rachel Maynes was still... she wrote, she was a historian who taught in a technical institution. She taught about the history of electrical technology. And it's kind of fluky. There's a whole cool story about how she got interested in vibrators. Her basic intention is that around the turn of the century, a little before that, doctors and midwives were treating hysteria in women by manipulating their genitals manually and creating a paroxysm. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Which, as I said in my review of this book, which I wrote—it's the only book review I ever wrote for the \textit{Society for Scientific Journal of Sex Research}—I said, I have to assume that these men all had wives who were not orgasmic. Otherwise, they would have recognized what was going on with their patients as an orgasm. But it's mysterious to me. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} But anyway, she wrote on this for the... she wrote a paper about this for the international... as she even electrical engineers, and they had a newsletter. The society of... I don't remember what it's called. I eat something sometimes. She wrote that and she, anyway, she published an article and people thought it was a joke because it was called \textit{The Vibrator as a Labor Saving Device}. That's how they were using it. It took a long time to do this manually. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Is the vibrator real? 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} She had orgasm in it. So who thought that was a joke? 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} All the people who received the antics thought it was like an April Fool's edition of their magazine; it was just too ridiculous. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} She actually, I think, lost her job at the technical institution where she was teaching. I don't know if she lives in Buffalo, New York. I think there's a famous tech institute there. Or maybe she wasn't; I don't remember the details of that, but she essentially got completely rejected by them. Then Johns Hopkins published her little book, and they had no idea. It was like it hit; the little book was like this big, it had a review this big in the New York Times book review section. And it just went crazy. It was a very interesting book. You can read it in like an hour. It's not a great book, but you can read it. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} So anyway, Rachel... the movie that was made—don't ask me the title; I have it over there on my bookshelf—they made these two women filmmakers made a movie in which she was the main person interviewed. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} And then you were not talking ahead. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} I was not talking ahead, and I met them fairly early on in their production, and I was like, why aren't you including me in this movie? Because they had all of you. Some of the people they had, some woman who was a well-known comedian or something, she had nothing to do with the sex business. She made some comments about vibrators, and then all the other usual suspects were in there, but I may include your joys and elders. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} So I'm not... and I'm not an orgasmic either, although I know a bunch of people who are. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} But you're in \textit{Sticky} the movie. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I'm in \textit{Sticky} the movie, and I had to ask Nicholas. I said, am I in that movie? So of course you are. I said, oh god, I don't remember anything about it. And he reminded me about what I said, and I saw him. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} I'm having really bad memory problems right now. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Is he a West Coast person? 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} No. Oh wait a minute. Maybe he's in Illinois. I can't remember. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} No, I can't. I was going to say the East Coast media just dismissing once again the West Coast. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} No, no, because a lot of the people who made the other movie were not East Coast. They were from the West Coast. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} So as down there, Press grew. I mean, you told me the story about the initial workbook that you wanted to publish. How did your vision for the press change? 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Well, I have to say it grew like Topsy. I am so not into growth, I can't tell you. I mean, it didn't occur to me, well, let's have a plan. Let's publish a book about this and a book about this in this order. Let's look for an author who's going to do this. Nah

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And I took one of those books to my calligraphy teacher, who was about practicing my calligraphy, and she was like, *Oh, I wish the listeners could see my face.* I don't remember what she said. Maybe she didn't have a negative reaction; I just made it up because it's a good story. I remember her being kind of like, *I wonder what this is.* She said my calligraphy was quite good. It was like a six-class course at my local rec center. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} That's it? I took it. Oh yeah, and then I hand-lettered. I'm not a good calligrapher. It didn't have to be. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Yes. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} I took a calligraphy course because I hated my handwriting. I wanted my general handwriting to be better. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} And you said your anti-growth, but despite that... 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Well, the people who sort of took over running Good Vibrations when I was backing off from my role, some of them believe—and I think they're right—that Good Vibrations never would have gotten very big if I had been in charge. I didn't care; I just did it because it was the right thing to do, and it just seemed like the right thing to do. I tried, you know, the same thing with turning it into a worker co-op. That was probably not the most effective way to maximize profits. I didn't feel right running it as a business where I was the boss. I wasn't acting like the boss anyway. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} People say, *What differences were there after you became a worker co-op?* 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Like, I don't know. I mean, we always had democratic management. I'll never forget when Mary Ann Zanker—remember her?—was working for the store, and we didn't really have a bookkeeping system then. We had no inventory system at all. She said, *You know, we really ought to have some kind of a minimal inventory system.* And that was just in the days when computers were just starting. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Mm-hm. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} And I said, *Go find one, and I'll buy it.* Because I said, I didn't get it. She did. I actually think I found one that was cheaper, and it was terrible. Because I'm the big bargain hunter. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} And you know, I have to say, I had a great luxury that most people do not have when they're starting their own businesses. This is definitely true for this store and the publishing company too, which was that I bought a house. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} It'll be hard for people to understand this, who know a lot about housing prices in the Bay Area before the crash. But I bought a house on the San Francisco Peninsula. I had been here about five or six weeks when I bought a house that was a bargain at \$39,500 because almost all the houses around there on that block cost \$45,000 to \$50,000. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} My house only cost \$39,500. It was a three-bedroom house. When I got married in 1977, my husband came to live there. He had grown up in that area. We had housemates most of the time because we didn't want our kid to be alone. Partly, we had housemates with children, with one or two children, single moms, because we wanted our daughter to have someone to play with. We thought it was fun to have housemates. My mortgage was \$225 a month, and even with county taxes and insurance, it totaled \$300 a month to live there. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} So in a year, we charged our roommates \$250. For most of that time, Mark and I each contributed \$25 towards housing. I was teaching a workshop at the Women's Center that we started—not that I started, but I was involved with them. We lived in San Mateo County, which is a very conservative county. They call it the *Orange County of Northern California,* south of San Francisco. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I taught a class at the Women's Center called *How to Live Very Well on Very Little.* It was about how to live really, really well with \$400 a month. I was doing it, and I taught this class about how to do it. It was very popular. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Where does that frugality come from? You talked to me before; I got here, we emailed a little bit about parking, and you said you're very frugal. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} My parents, my mother in particular. I think both of my parents were frugal, but my mother was a little more aware of it because she did most of the shopping. In terms of grocery shopping, both of my parents always went to the day-old food first. Cut vegetables and meat were marked down because it was their last day on the shelf. I don't know; it's just how my parents were. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} There's a very famous Boston institution called Filene's Basement. It doesn't exist anymore. We used to joke with my mother that she used to camp out there on the night before sales. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Yeah, I know Filene's Basement is no more. I went to a Filene's store a long time ago, but it lasted for a long time after I left. But when I started to have to shop for clothes for myself, I was shocked at how much they cost because I was used to buying everything at Filene's Basement. So I switched my allegiance to shopping at Goodwill, Salvation Army, and thrift stores. Now, when I moved to California, I buy a new piece of clothing about once every five years. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} And you go on the round... 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} ...or exceptions, but even my shoes I get used. My sister used to say, *Oh, how can you wear somebody else's shoes?* 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Well, Lee, maybe you can because you were involved in some of the business aspects of Down There Press. How would you describe the business side of that? 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Well, we were very fortunate because Good Vibrations was doing so well and thriving and growing. I think, first, Mary Ann Sanker, Kathy Winks, and Ann Seaman were taking hold of Good Vibrations. J

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} But it was fair. It was complicated, and you know, the computers didn't have the capacity at all. I was putting together the \textit{Herodica}, doing the typesetting, and creating the sexuality catalog, the book catalog, which was just starting. I think Mary-in was doing the \textit{Good Vibrations} catalog, I guess. So, they just kind of took hold of the company and grew it. The computer was just... the internet still wasn't there, but the ads, the places they chose to put ads, everything was happening. There was a confluence of the stars or something, but the company just took off, and we just kept growing and growing. We had to move a few blocks away to the store on Valencia Street.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} And it just went. Down There Press was in an extraordinarily fortunate position because we had this financial backer. They bought a lot of our books. \textit{Good Vibrations} did. It's so funny; they always kept saying they bought a lot of our books. It was like... it was all R. It was like... well, it just didn't make... well, there was a lot of sense. It was just a department of the store. It was the store. It was so different, you know, being a publishing company and stores. We were much smaller.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} So, how many people were working at Down There Press when you were working on it?

\textbf{Joni Blank:} We, by ourselves, 0.5, 0.75.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And you mean in addition to you?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} No, or you were doing other stuff. That was... yeah, that was when you were doing all the other stuff. A few times, I would have like a part-time assistant. Technically, I was in the beginning, and it was all available. Back to no word that means life's around. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Lee and I did a lot of advice and consent things together. I mean, she did a lot of things I didn't care about. I didn't pay attention to what she did, and then there were things that she consulted me about or I proposed to her. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Yeah, we were... and this, it's socially, this was kind of hard because the rest of the company was looking like... it wasn't that bad. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Joan is making faces and shrugging. But no, no. That's true. We're not on television. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} I think it was a very collegial environment. I mean, one year we made what felt like a ton of money, and I announced it at our annual meeting, and people clapped and applauded. I think everybody really liked having this educational aspect; it wasn't just selling the products. They loved the books, you know? They were selling a lot, relatively speaking; they were our best customers.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Who did your book design on the covers?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Well, we used various designers. At some point in the '90s, I think Anne said, "You're just spending so much time doing the page layout. Why don't you find somebody else to do the page layout?" I was like, "Oh my gosh, I could save so much money!" But it did take everything else off my plate.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And what I would like to ask each of you is, what are you proudest of that came out of Down There Press?

\textbf{Joni Blank:} I actually can't put a finger on something. I think it's a little bit... I think just that we were out there doing it. I think we made it possible for all kinds of other publishers to do stuff. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} And it's the same thing with the store. A woman in Nevada named Lynn Kamala did her doctoral dissertation on sex-positive feminist sex toy stories—not the word feminist, although they are. She's in women's studies, and she did her dissertation. She's still working on a book based on her dissertation. She came to the Bay Area not too long ago, actually a couple of years ago, and she did a reading at the Center for Sex and Culture of a section of her book. I came in late, and she had already decided not to read the part on \textit{Good Vibrations}, the chapter in \textit{Good Vibrations}, because everybody there was really familiar with it. So, she read the section on E-Style, which preceded \textit{Good Vibrations}. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} But you know, I was there, and so after the event, I said she had interviewed me a long time ago, and she said, "I'll send you the chapter in \textit{Good Vibrations} so you can look at it." But she didn't send it, and finally, I contacted her maybe a year later and said, "Lynn, whatever happened to that chapter?"

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} And she said, "Well, I can't because \textit{Good Vibrations} is throughout the entire book." After the first chapter, she said, "I started saying, this story is also one of the ones that was started by the \textit{Good Vibrations} model. This story isn't based on the \textit{Good Vibrations} model." So, she basically made \textit{Good Vibrations} the model for sex-positive sex toy stories. I didn't make that language up, but we were the first. I mean, Eve's Garden did exist before \textit{Good Vibrations}, but it wasn't a store. I mean, the whole showroom called it a store, but it used to be on the 14th floor of an office building, and she had mail; she was a mail-order company. She still does, I think, although I tried to find out something about the current status of Eve's Garden recently, and I couldn't find out exactly what was going on. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} But this whole concept of having a store where you sold this kind of thing, including those kinds of books, was more about the store than it was about the books. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} So, I am really... I guess I'm proud of the whole thing that kind of happened in spite of me. I don't feel like it happened because of me. People tell me that it did, and I say, "Oh, it happened because of you." This all happened, and people are happier. I mean, I'm glad to hear

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} I just don't want to do it, even though I could, if I could find a way to finance hiring people to do it. I'm like, yeah, I don't want to do it. 

And so I decided to put it up on the internet and make it available for free download. And she made all the PDFs for me, which was really cool. She had to work them over again; it was complicated. The pages didn't come out all the same size, and she just put a ton of work into it. She wouldn't accept any money. I mean, eventually, when they get public, I'm actually on a sender. I'm on a sender like several hundred. So, I mean, now it's for free download. 

I'm going to give her the right to download anytime she wants and sell it to anybody she wants to, you know, just among her friendship group. I'm going to treat them to it. But they can free download it too, if she wants to print out some or whatever. I don't care. She just said it is a labor of love, and I'm doing it now as a labor of love to get it out there. 

But it's really important that there is still no other book out for little kids, for really little kids. I did the playbook first because I had the model. Then I tried to sell that to some library, and they wouldn't have it because it's what they call a consumable format, right? Libraries don't want books you can write in or are encouraged to write in. 

So I basically did the same, but have you seen those books, by the way? 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Yeah, I saw.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} So I basically did the same text in a non-worked format. It turned out that it was available to much younger children because the kids who were ready to read it weren't old enough to read the playbook themselves or write in them. 

For a while, a lot of people bought both of them, and they would read it to their little kids. When the kids started to feel self-conscious, then they were old enough to hear, “Take the playbook, take it in your room, and you don't have to show it to anybody.” So I just thought that was brilliant to do it that way. 

But to this day, there are still no other books for young kids that aren't about babies or reproduction. I was thinking of it when you were talking about the printers for "I Am My Lover" and men loving themselves. 

Along the way, there was a very important court case around the book "Show Me," where it was no longer permissible to have a book that showed little kids who were nude with genitalia or touching. A lot of... I think at that point, there was a lot of pullback from printers as to what they would do. 

And that was in the mid-80s. I want to say around the mid-80s, we went to ABA once and found out there was a remainder's publisher, a remainder's bookseller that was selling hundreds and hundreds of copies of "Show Me." I told Anta to go back and buy them all. 

And she went back. Then I talked to somebody who knew about this, and they said, “You could go to jail for owning one copy of that book. Why are you buying so many?” 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} In the mid-80s? I bet all. I think so after the Mish commission, maybe. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Yeah, it was scary. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Oh, and? I'm glad to be in the late 80s then. Well, whenever it was, eventually, I did buy a thousand copies from St. Morton's Press. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} You bought a thousand copies? 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Yeah, and then I had this great idea. I realized as soon as I thought of it, I think we should just give these copies to like 100 people and have them walk around. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} I'm on a worship. They're going to arrest us all and put us in jail. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} No, but they probably would have raised me in jail. You were doing a simultaneous. 

Well, I don't remember the law, but in either California law or federal law, one was you couldn't have pictures of children engaged in sexual activity, whatever that means, or children posed nude so as to arouse the viewer. One of them is federal law, and the other one is state law. 

And you know, there's a very sweet picture in "Show Me" of two kids, one boy and one girl, sitting sort of with their knees up facing the camera, and they're naked. The girl is looking into the boy's crotch, and she might have her hand on his thigh, and she's not touching his penis. But children engaged in sexual activity, or children posed so as to arouse the viewer, that's a crap shoot. You know, clothed or naked or something. 

You got in trouble for that. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Taking clothed children? 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Mm-hmm. Seductive? What does that mean? Look posed so to arouse the viewer? It was a book that was very well regarded. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Well, oh yeah, I mean, just people are in such a tremendous appellate. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} The book, which book? "Show Me"? You can still buy it. You can buy it now, and people who buy it now are pedophiles. I mean, on Amazon, used books. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} I haven't actually looked lately. How do you know that? 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} A lot of people who buy it are pedophiles. 

First of all, I need to explain what a pedophile is. A pedophile is different from a child molester. A pedophile is someone who's turned on by those images. Then, substantially, the vast majority of people who masturbate to those images never touch a child. 

I want to straighten that out because people use the terms interchangeably. A pedophile is someone who molests children, or at least fondles them physically. Not true. 

We wouldn't call, if we called everybody who is turned on by fantasies of rape a rapist instead of a raptophile, which is the technical term, we would be in big trouble. And that's true for women who enjoy fantasies of being raped, as well as men who enjoy fantasies of raping people. 

99.99\% of whom never do it. Think about doing it.

\maketitle

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} I don't know if it's also going to be hard for you to choose one thing that you're proud of, but I wonder if there is one publication or challenge that came up during your time at Down Their Press that you're particularly proud of.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} I think it's more, as I said, just being in a position to be able to get this information out to people. You know, so that they can approach sexuality in their bodies in a more accepting way, to be more comfortable.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Right. And frankly, I'm really proud of us being the only ones who are doing it. I mean, it's not every other series, like the Herodica series, which was the beginning of a huge erotic short story movement, not just for women. You know, Susie went on to do the Best American Erotic series, and now there's a whole new batch of works coming up. The Best American Erotic Short Stories or something that Suzy's doing; she's involved in a whole new series with this woman who interviewed her about them.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Well, and look at the romance novels. I mean, they've evolved from just, "Oh, and then they fell into bed," to a whole sub-genre that actually includes a lot of sex.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} One of the early books that came out was \textit{The Lady's Home Marottica}, which was originally called \textit{Something Different}. They changed it to \textit{The Ladies on Marottica} to sort of make a joke on the \textit{Ladies' Journal}. What we used to say about that book—and I know one of the women who wrote in that book—was that they were part of the Kensington Ladies Society, which is near the road here. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Probably I know some of the others, but what I remember in particular is that those stories often stopped at the bedroom door. Some of them were very sexually arousing, but as soon as the couple opened their bedroom door, that was the next story. I'm not saying they weren't a turn-on to people; they were. But to get explicit about who does what to whom, to what body parts, and to include that in your literary effort, or to talk about things that were a little kinkier, was much more accepting. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} There was an explosion, and \textit{Herodica} is legitimately credited with being the daughter of that movement. It's so funny because it's not a comic status. I can still picture the covers perfectly.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} What's interesting is that I'm into the sexual self-help stuff. That was always a sideline for me. I mean, it wasn't actually a sideline because it ended up being such a big piece, but I just didn't think it was as important to me. It's probably because I'm not a reader of literature, even children's stories. I just don't read full books. I rarely read one, and when I do, it's nonfiction. The only time I've ever read a fiction book cover to cover in the last 30 or 40 years was when I was recovering from surgery and had to read every day because I couldn't do anything else. So I'm not a reader; I publish books. I haven't even read all the books that Down There Press published.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I was going to ask you about that several times, but I never did. I read all of Martha's book pretty much, but that was impressive because it was like 500 pages—the big book of masturbation. An important book. Epic.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Lee, can you think of any unusual story or anecdote that you want to share about your time there, interactions with an author, or production?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Nothing really leaps out. You know, I haven't thought about this stuff for five or six years. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Tell me about the fate of Down There Press.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Well, in 2004, we had been through yet another distributor bankruptcy with Book People and found another distributor, SCB Books, who seemed pretty respectable and legitimate. By then, Good Vibrations was in a bit of financial shakiness. There were a lot of new people coming in and some changes. We got a new CPA who was doing the books differently. We had been doing them on a tax basis, which is a little different from straight accounting. The new accountants were saying, "Oh, Down There Press is losing so much money." 

The decision at the upper levels was made; we had maybe 100 employees at that point, mostly worker-owners. Not everyone was an owner at that point; there were still people in their eligibility period. Management had taken much stronger hold and decided that there wasn't going to be a Down There publishing program anymore. By then, we not only had the books but also had bought a small audio company called Passion Press, which we had licensed \textit{Herodica} to, and they were doing just sex books. Good Vibrations also started a video company whose name I can't remember; that was after my time.

So they decided that all those pieces of Good Vibrations wouldn't work anymore and wouldn't exist. A couple of years later, by then I had left the company, they sold the press to SCB Distributors. The information I got about all that came through Joni, and I don't really have any first-hand knowledge. They bought the list, the name, the titles, and the publishing rights to all the books. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Did they keep any of the books in print?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} None of mine. Not a single one, although they talked about it. What's interesting about what happened is that they had a guy who was sort of their representative for Northern California. He decided to go on sabbatical but engineered this whole thing before he left. When he came back from sabbatical, he quit the company. So the people down at SCB, Patrick, whatever his name was, basically fixed his deal sort of against the buy-in from his bosses down in LA.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And so the whole thing went through, and then it was like, we have this publishing company. What are we going to do with this? The main guy down there didn't know; I didn't have a clue. He was a distributor. He had never published before. Well, that's... I don't know, I shouldn't say he had never published before, but they were book distributors, you know, about publishing. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} More than the people who are still dead, goodbye. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Vibrations, no, about publishing. Once Lee left—or it was let go, I should say—she made it sound like she left voluntarily. She didn't. Her getting rid of her was handled extremely badly, from what I've heard. It's embarrassing to even think about it. But they decided to continue with *Exhibitionism for the Shy* by Carol Queen, and *Anal Pleasure and Health* from the Jack Moron rewrote again. I think for them. I don't know if anyone is out working on it now. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} And what else? I don't even know. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And then they took... Maybe I'm trying to remember what they decided to do. Did they take any of the *Herodicus*? Did they do *Herodicus 6*? 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} No. Did you republish, read, read, read, put it out? 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} No, I don't know. See what happens? There were some of the books that they took boxes and boxes of—the books of the ones that they were going to continue distributing. But they were not going to distribute any of my books. At first, oh yeah, they were going to do *Female Yet* because it was such a good seller. So the company had three big selling books. There were others, but the three big selling ones were *Anal Pleasure and Health*, which resulted in a Brazilian copy since it was a *Female Yet*, and it had done really well even after the first, you know, for many years. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And *Kids' First Book About Sex*, ironically out of another market, which I didn't allow them to be longer, so the cumulative was... And there may have been a couple of others I don't remember, but those were the three. My only one included in that batch was... they didn't want to do the kids' book. And they were there, almost gone. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} And then *Same Female* was gone. They had this fabulous reputation. They were going to do a *Female Yet* first, but they decided not to because they figured it was going to be too expensive to print it. They just wanted to do something, make it. It was a color book, and they had to get it printed in Hong Kong, and they didn't think they could get much money. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} The other thing about *Female* is that *I Am My Lover* is another one that they rejected because they said, these days you can go on the porn, you can get all the images you want free of people masturbating or pictures of women's genitals, whatever you want, you can get it. Why would anybody buy a book of that stuff anymore? And I think they're actually right, probably. I'm not saying that it wouldn't go if it was published. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} This break didn't break. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} A new book of all was done. I'll show this to you after the interview. But anyway, I think it would have gone still, and I can tell you that the few copies of the email I acquired—a handful of hurt copies mostly. They gave all of my... they actually tried to sell the books that were going to be shredded to the authors of them and/or the editors of them. Initially, they were going to charge them like 50\% of cover or a third, you know, I mean 30\% of cover. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} And somebody said, wait a second, you have to sell these at remainder prices. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} So they reduced it a little bit, or somewhat. Like Martha bought two boxes of her books, and people bought. Then the rest of them went to the shredder. In my case, they didn't charge me anything. They let me take all I wanted, but I didn't have room. I took 200 and 250 copies of *I Am My Lover: First Person Sexual*, which is selling for, you know, a dollar on Amazon now, or less. And a whole bunch of playbooks for men and a few playbooks for women. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Are you keeping all these? 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} That I have in my storage area in the basement. I actually, last year and the year before, sold a few of the hurt, slightly hurt, *Females* on Amazon for \$75 to \$85 each. And they were the cheapest ones among those available; they go up to \$900. There's crazy stuff on used books in Amazon. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} I looked at it, but the books—and like a kid's first book—you can buy one for, you know, \$350. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I had such a touching thing happen just last week. I got this letter from a woman whose child has been adopted—a pretty seriously artistic boy, seven years old. They really want to give him some sex education, and he's gotten into this wonderful school. Maybe he's not just an ordinary child; he has some important disability. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And now they found a wonderful school for him. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Oh, I take that back. He doesn't have a disability. He had an absolutely horrendous, chaotic childhood where he was majorly sexually abused and physically abused. That's what it is. Both of his therapists and his teacher said, you've got to get this book, *Kids' First Book About Sex*, for your son. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} And she went on Amazon. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} The cheapest one of the *Kids' First Book About Sex* was \$125, but she ordered it anyway because she didn't know that she might be able to get one somewhere else. Fortunately, I say, the company that had advertised it didn't have any; it wasn't really there. So Amazon got back to her and said, we can't. 

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And then she found my

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} That book should be out again. I mean, the PDF is so wonderful, but it's also nice for kids to hold. Well, it's going to be available for free downloads so people can print it out.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Yeah, I know. I would love it if you can find me a publisher. I'll be back in a minute. I am making the rounds. So there you go. 

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Yeah. And I, the playbook, it's nice too. And what I'm going to put, I'm probably going to put the kids' first book on Kindle so people could use it that way and hold it with their kids. But we're not going to do that with the playbook. We're just going to have a little note that says, "There's a playbook, and this is what it is." We'll include the URL on the Kindle, and people can go and download and print it out because it's no good to the right of it.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} And Lee, do you want to talk about your departure from Down There Press?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} No, no. And do you think, as Joni just said, there's anything you want to add in terms of what happened with the books going to the distributor? Is there anything else that you think you want to add?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} Well, as I said, I wasn't there when it all happened. By then, I sort of distanced myself anyway. They didn't feel quite so much like my babies anymore. Yes, it happened. I was sad. I remember standing in a basement when they were saying, "And the book that doesn't go with you, Joni, in this batch of books that somebody's going to bring over to your house, are going to the shredder." Thousands of books. Several thousand books. Yeah, it was really hard to take books burning. 

It was like after 2001, the whole industry changed. The internet took off. People weren't, whereas up to then, I think everybody had been sort of open and exploring and excited about, you know, new things. Like, what can I find out about sex? People kind of shut down after 9/11. I came up with a little thing: they wanted community, they wanted communication, they wanted continuity, they wanted values, you know, like core values. 

And good vibes, I think, were sort of going off in this, you know, how can we attract new customers? We have to get edgy or edgier. They've gotten a little bit away from that core audience of, quote, middle America, middle-aged women in their 40s maybe, who didn't have access to all the clubs and whatnot in San Francisco, and they didn't necessarily want that. 

I don't think getting a vibrator was exciting for them. I don't think they went away from it as much as they went towards more edgy stuff, and it got to be a bigger and bigger part of what they were doing. They also started selling novelties and stuff that, you know, never would have been sold there at the first point. 

So I think, I mean, we had been, there was a sex book club, and we had been selling, you know, a couple thousand copies of one of the books to them pretty regularly. We got down to our last 500 copies, and I needed to reorder. At that time, print on demand hadn't quite kicked in. We still needed to order four or five thousand copies to get a decent unit cost. So I ordered my 5,000 copies, and then they stopped ordering the book. 

So here we are stuck with, you know, a few thousand copies of this title. It's amazing. You know, it was, I'm sure that was one of the books that went to the shredder in quantity. There was actually one of the things, just the timing was so crying, but I think at that point there was a different sense of... 

And it was shortly after that that book people went under, and there were other presses in the sex area that started folding. I mean, part of it was that they were slammed by book people losing, going bankrupt. But things just started to fall apart. There wasn't that sense of enthusiasm and energy, I think. 

Yeah, there was one little story about a CV, the distributors. At one point, I said something to Erin Silverman, the guy at CV. I'm a little surprised that you didn't consider redoing *Good Vibrations: The Complete Guide to Vibrators*. I thought it was actually a little out of date, and I was hoping they would give me some money to work with Anne Whitten alone, helping me with it the last time to help update it, even though she was now in public health school or something, trying to support a kid as a single parent and may not have had much time. 

But anyway, I was willing to actually redo it. They signed a contract with me. They were supposed to do a contract with me to do it, and they agreed to give me $200 extra or something, or $300 extra to get some help doing it. I was not thrilled about the way I was being treated by them. But they sent me a contract that was obviously grabbed from somewhere else. It was full of things that were not appropriate for this, and they hadn't bothered to even change the language. 

So I made tons of changes in it, and I initialed all of them. I sent it back to Erin, and he agreed. He signed it without initialing all those places himself. I said, "I'm not willing to do this without you." In the meantime, I had found somebody on Craigslist who would scan the book for me so I could work from it. I said, "You don't have to, when you do a scan, optical character scan, there are a lot of mistakes, but I said, I don't care. I'm going to be rewriting the whole thing anyway. Just do it so I'll have something basic to work from." 

Yeah, I think I paid this guy $35, and he came, picked it up, and brought it back to me. It was very inexpensive because he didn't have to process it. All he had to do was just scan it and get it to me. But anyway, I had done that. And then Erin, I called him on the phone or something. I said, "Yeah, you've given me back this contract, but all the places I initialed you haven't touched." 

He said, "I don't know, this is just too much trouble. I think I'm just not, I don't know, but I don't want to do this anymore." And I basically said, "Screw it. I didn't really want to revise it anyway." And he had sent me an advance.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} So, I sent back the contract with \textit{void} written on every page because he signed it at that point. I wrote \textit{void} on every page and I sent him the rest. I subtracted the dollars I spent for the scan, which was about thirty-five dollars—maybe it was forty-five or fifty-five; I don't remember. I said, "This is an expense I had; I'm not going to send it back." I sent him the rest of it back with a check.

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I was into it and \textit{Good Vibrations: A Complete Guide to Vibrators} is dead, although they seem to keep finding more copies at \textit{Good Vibrations}. At one point, they weren't paying royalties at all to any of us who had books with them. David Steinberg and I both complained about that a lot. I don't know if the other authors did. Finally, they just picked a dollar amount and said, "Just count this as royalties on any books that we still have." You had to sign that this was it. I know it was not very much—just a couple hundred dollars, maybe three hundred dollars. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} And that's it. They wouldn't tell me how many copies they had, which is really frustrating. They should have paid royalties on every single one. They could have waited until they sold them, but then they... So I felt like I got ripped off. I didn't have any choice, though. They've made so much from \textit{Good Vibrations: A Complete Guide to Vibrators}. I don't know if that's very popular anymore. It's such a skimpy little book and it's so dated. It was a very comforting little book to people who were using vibrators for the first time. I wish it had stayed up. You know, it was one of my real babies; it was one of the ones I did really early. Even that wasn't hand-lettered anymore.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} So, what year did Down There Press officially close?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} It's not closed; it's still called Down There Press. I think it was 2007, something like that. Seven. I don't even know. You want me to remember dates? Forget it. I don't do dates. My mother and father died without me ever knowing their birthdays. I knew my mother's in the genre; my files are in February. That's about all I've got.

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Are there things—I'm sure there's a lot more we could talk about—but is there anything that stands out as something we haven't discussed that you want to go on the record?

\textbf{Lee Davidson:} I don't think so. Should we do that in unison again? I don't think so.

\textbf{Susanne Snyder:} Thank you so much for talking about the history of the press and more. Thank you. 

\textbf{Joni Blank:} Last year, getting into it before everybody disappears. That's a pretty long list. I want everybody to know before hanging out that my sweet little dog has been sitting quietly on my lap, sleeping most of the time. Perfect. And this is what makes everybody think that he's a sweet little dog because he's not barking. He was wonderful. Right? Very good dog.
