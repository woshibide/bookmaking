This is called against bourgeois art. 

War on the horizon. 
A ship with a bloody sail. 
Andy Young slips on his chamberlain appeasement, get up, he got from years listening to the CP Hype Martin Luther King. 
Is there somebody here to record this? 
United States being thrown out the front door, 
the Russian bear charging through the back door. 
Carmichael suddenly clearly an apologist for new-style colonialism, 
	telling us we-  
	can't fight in the United States
though, centuries of our blood, 
centuries of our dead, 
our buried here, 
oceans of our blood have fertilized a black nation, 
afrozone in the south. 
Is there someone here to get this down? 
Can I get a, like they say, witness an eye that can see through this here? 
In Jimmy Carter's snake oil show there is a room nobody talks about. 
A steel door fumes, seep underneath, inside blood and hair on the floor.  
bones stacked in the corner, 
photos of garing 
and gabbles 
and Joe McCarthy 
and Nixon in the nude trying to put helmets on their pecker woods. 
Will somebody put this stuff out? 

You walk through a museum, 
all the colors of the spectrum right there, 
but not one image except of checks passing, 
Pollock dollar signs, decooning fortunes, 
Larry Rivers pots at the end of the rainbow, 
no people, 
no love, 
no heart and soul, 

insides flowing out, 
no fighting in the street, 
no fucking.  
No fire's ripped the sky, 
no children screaming death, 
no police, no state except it is the state bullshitting on the wall. 
No people struggle just colors thrown by baby snooks, 
a down and leaving unintellectual. 
No record of this place, 
as while the motherfucking join as America is, 
somebody should get this shit down. 
Otherwise, no one will believe it. 

Get it down, get it on the record, 
get the hate, the horror, the lies, the Rockefeller monsters eating corpses. 

Hey bro, 
say hey, 
what it is dude, 
yeah, 
do it.  

Do it, is you? 

Wow, wow. 

Do the roux, 
baby, 
	baby, 
		baby. 

Karen, radio on his shoulder. 
They eating corpses, 
coal mines, 
garment center, 
assembly lines, 
hot steaming steel, 
pour through space. 
Not any of life is there. 

Hey, poet, 
	hey, 
		poet, 
hey, poet, 
you artist. 
He turns in the shadows, sucking a marble, 
dribbling Andy Warhol's lost nut. 
He is an artist. 
He is a Poe 8, 
	a Poe 9, too. 

His work is about everything. 
His work is about the universe.  
Her work is about stars, 
	belching. 
Her work is about gray hair lost in the desert, 
						peeped in a teeny voice. 
No babies, 
no screams, 
no red life, 
no future deaths. 
Peeped in a teeny, teeny voice. 

Stupidity dripped in a sultry voice. 
Bushwild poich, yodeled nonsense about boring absence. 
They think up funny ways for letters to sit on the page. 
Concrete bullshit, arty dumb shit, they are safe as old toilet paper. 

Revolution sweeps the world, but Bushwild artists stay-  
There at crumbs of dust in the light, 
people struggle, 
change reality, 
but these dull imitation poets 
				talk to us of fragmented, 
nothingness 
like 
two-cell creatures trying to be bought. 
The world is heavier than they know. 
They do not know. 
They fight knowledge with abstraction and think they cool because they talk to themselves. 
They are full of shit 
like vultures snacking on an open grave. 
They are pole dying capitalism and give themselves ass. 
They think they shit is profound enough.  
and complex, 
but the people think it is as profound and complex as monkey thoughts. 
Now meditate on that.
